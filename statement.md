# Hospital Navigation System - Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Navigating large hospital facilities can be overwhelming and stressful for patients, especially when they're already dealing with health concerns. Patients often struggle to find the right departments, waste valuable time moving between floors, and experience increased anxiety due to unclear directions. This inefficiency not only impacts patient experience but also affects hospital operations by creating congestion at information desks and delaying medical care.

## Scope of the Project

The Hospital Navigation System is designed to provide intelligent, symptom-based guidance to help patients quickly locate the appropriate medical departments within a multi-story hospital facility.

**Included in Scope:**
- Symptom-to-department mapping for common medical conditions
- Multi-floor hospital layout with department information
- Interactive patient guidance system
- Room-level navigation within departments
- Common disease and treatment area associations

**Out of Scope:**
- Real-time doctor availability or appointment scheduling
- Medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations
- Prescription management
- Integration with hospital EHR systems
- Mobile application development (initial phase)
- Real-time queue management

## Target Users

**Primary Users:**
- **New Patients**: Individuals visiting the hospital for the first time who need clear directions
- **Elderly Patients**: Senior citizens who may find large hospital layouts confusing
- **Anxious Patients**: People experiencing stress who need straightforward guidance
- **Non-Emergency Cases**: Patients with routine concerns seeking appropriate departments

**Secondary Users:**
- **Hospital Staff**: Can use the system to provide consistent directions to patients
- **Patient Companions**: Family members or friends assisting patients in navigation
- **Hospital Administrators**: For understanding common patient flow patterns
